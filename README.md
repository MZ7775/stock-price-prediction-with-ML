This project leverages Machine Learning (ML) algorithms to predict stock prices based on historical market data. It uses the Yahoo Finance API (yfinance) to fetch real-time stock data, which is then preprocessed by handling missing values, normalizing prices, and engineering key financial indicators. Various ML models, such as Linear Regression, Random Forest, and LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory networks), are trained to recognize patterns in historical price movements. The trained model forecasts future stock prices and is evaluated using metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE). This project demonstrates how AI can be applied in financial markets for trend analysis and decision-making, and it can be further extended by integrating deep learning models or real-time market sentiment analysis.
